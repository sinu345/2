## What is IPQC and Why is it Important?

IPQC refers to the quality control measures implemented *during* the manufacturing process. Unlike final inspection, which catches defects at the end, IPQC aims to identify and correct issues *as they arise*. This proactive approach leads to:

*   **Reduced scrap and rework:** Catching errors early prevents further processing of defective parts.
*   **Improved product quality:** Consistent monitoring ensures adherence to standards throughout production.
*   **Cost savings:** Minimizing defects translates to lower material costs and increased efficiency.
*   **Enhanced customer satisfaction:** Delivering high-quality products builds trust and loyalty.

This free IPQC course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively implement and manage IPQC processes.
