## What is an HPA Engine?

An HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) engine automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in a deployment or replication controller based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics. Essentially, it scales your application to handle varying levels of traffic and demand. It's a core component of Kubernetes and cloud-native application management. This free course provides a thorough introduction, even if you’re new to Kubernetes.
